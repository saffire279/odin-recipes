With this easy recipe, you'll be making an easy custard you can customize with any flavors you want. Don't like vanilla? Add some chocolate. Want strawberry? Add some strawberry extract and some chunks. Whatever flavors you want to make, you can do it right here.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar, and salt until sugar completely dissolves, ~5 minutes. Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (~170 degrees on a thermometer).</li>
            <li>Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according to the maker's instructions. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or freeze to taste.</li>
        </ol>
