        <h3>Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>16 oz full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>5 and 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>pinch of salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Grease two 9" cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined, ~1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and vinegar and beat on high for 2 minutes. (Set egg whites aside.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.</li>
            <li>With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 2-3 additions alternating with the buttermilk. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until combined. Vigorously whisk or beat the 4 egg whites on high speed until fluffy peaks form, ~3 minutes. Gently fold into cake batter. The batter will be silky and slightly thick.</li>
            <li>Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 30-32 minutes, or until the tops of the cakes spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If the cakes need a little longer as determined by wet crumbs on the toothpick, bake for longer. However, careful not to overbake as the cakes may dry out. Remove cakes from the oven and cool copmletely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, ~2 minutes. Add the confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy. Add more confectioners' sugar if frosting is too thin or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Frosting should be soft, but not runny.</li>
            <li>Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. An icing spatual and/or bench scraper for the frosting. (Check our utensils out at our website www.imthebesthereobv.com.)</li>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Piping tips can be used for that extra wow factor on your cake if you would like. Choices like the Wilton piping tips can fit most of your needs.</li>
            <li>Leftover cake can be stored in refrigerator for up to 5 days if covered tightly.</li>
            <li>Cake layers, frosted or unfrosted,can be frozen for 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and warm to room temperature before serving/decorating.</li>
            <li>Leftover cake crumbs can also be sprinkled in a design on the top of your cake, or just however you would like. Remember, this is YOUR cake. You can do whatever you would like to do with it. You are only restricted by your materials.</li>
